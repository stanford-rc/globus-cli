"""
A wrapper which nicely integrates SDK IdentityMaps into the CLI.

This was originally implemented in gcs-cli and ported into here.

A "resolver" is defined with a field it uses in each item from the response data as the
full principal value. This is the "key".
Typical usage should be to define a resolver in each command which needs resolution, to
provide the key to use. Definition may have to happen outside of a command to
accommodate field lists which are defined as constants, and this is supported.

A resolver provides a field handler for principal URNs + a pagination callback to get
all principals from each page of results added to the ID map.
It can also be initialized to take identity IDs (not in Principal URN format).

This lets us get some of the benefit of the IdentityMap bulk calls without forcing the
whole paginated call to be walked at once.

This also lets us keep the resolution work only in the text-mode printed output (and not
applied on JSON output).
