== SYNOPSIS

*globus endpoint role show* ['OPTIONS'] 'ENDPOINT_ID' 'ROLE_ID'


== DESCRIPTION

The *globus endpoint role show* command shows information for a specific role
granted to a user or group on an endpoint. It does not show information about
the permissions granted by a role; only what role a user or group has been
granted, by name.

You must have sufficient privileges to see the roles on the endpoint.

The principal is a user or group ID, and the principal type says which of these
types the principal is. The term "Principal" is used in the sense of "a
security principal", an entity which has some privileges associated with it.
