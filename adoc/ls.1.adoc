globus ls - List endpoint directory contents

== SYNOPSIS

*globus ls* ['OPTIONS'] 'ENDPOINT_ID[:PATH]'

The *globus ls* command lists files and subdirectories on an endpoint. If no
path is given, the default directory on that endpoint will be used.

line in alphabetical order.  Directories are always displayed with a
trailing '/'.

== OPTIONS

*-a, --all*::

Show hidden files and directories that start with '.'

*-l, --long*::

Long form tabular output similar to 'ls -l'.

*-r, --recursive*::

Do a recursive listing similar to 'ls -R' only goes as deep as allowed by
the --recursive-depth-limit. Note that this can quickly become a very expensive
operation and may take a significant amount of time to complete or even fail on
rate limits.

*--recursive-depth-limit*::

Set the depth limit when using the --recursive option. Defaults to 3 if not
given.
