= GLOBUS RENAME(1)

== NAME

globus rename - Rename a file or directory on an endpoint

== SYNOPSIS

*globus rename* ['OPTIONS'] 'ENDPOINT_ID:SOURCE_PATH' 'ENDPOINT_ID:DEST_PATH'

== DESCRIPTION

The *globus rename* command renames a file or directory on an endpoint.

The old path must be an existing file or directory. The new path must not yet
exist.

The new path does not have to be in the same directory as the old path, but
most endpoints will require it to stay on the same filesystem.

The endpoint must be entered twice for the sake of path syntax consistency.
