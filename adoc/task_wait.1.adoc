= GLOBUS TASK WAIT(1)

== NAME

globus task wait - Wait for a Task to complete

== SYNOPSIS

*globus task wait* ['OPTIONS'] 'TASK_ID'

*globus task wait* *--timeout* 'N' *--polling-interval* 'M' *--heartbeat* ['OPTIONS'] 'TASK_ID'


== DESCRIPTION

The *globus task wait* command polls a task to see if it has completed. It
waits until the timeout is reached, checking every *M* seconds (where *M* is
the polling interval).

If the task succeeds by then, it exits with status 0. Otherwise, it exits with
status 1.

== OPTIONS

*--timeout* 'N'::

Wait a maximum of 'N' seconds. If omitted, *globus task wait* will wait
indefinitely, until the task succeeds or fails.

*--polling-interval* 'M'::

Check task status (and potentially hearbeat) every 'M' seconds. Defaults to 1.

*-H,--heartbeat*::

Turn on heartbeats. When set, a '.' character will be printed to standard error
every polling interval.

== OUTPUT

When text output is requested, no output is written to standard out. All output
is written to standard error.

When JSON output is requested, the standard error output remains, but the task
status after waiting will be sent to stdout.

== EXAMPLES

Wait 30 seconds for a task to complete, printing heartbeats to stderr and
producing a JSON description of the task at the end:

----
$ globus task wait --timeout 30 -H --format json TASK_ID
----

Wait for a task without limit, silently, polling every 5 minutes:

----
$ globus task wait --polling-interval 300 TASK_ID
----
