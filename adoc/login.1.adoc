= GLOBUS LOGIN(1)

== NAME

globus login - Log into Globus to get credentials for the Globus CLI

== SYNOPSIS

*globus login* ['OPTIONS']


== DESCRIPTION

The *globus login* command directs you to the page necessary to permit the
Globus CLI to make API calls for you, and gets the OAuth2 tokens needed
to use those permissions.

The default login method opens your browser to the Globus CLI's authorization
page, where you can read and consent to the permissions required to use the
Globus CLI. The CLI then takes care of getting the credentials through a
local server.

If the CLI detects you are on a remote session, or the
--no-local-server option is used, the CLI will instead print a link for you to
manually follow to the Globus CLI's authorization page. After consenting
you will then need to copy and paste the given access code from the web to
the CLI.


== OPTIONS

*--force*::

Login even if the CLI already has valid login credentials. Any existing
credentials will be removed from local storage and globally revoked.

*--no-local-server*::

Use manual login. You will be given a link to follow and must respond with
a copied and pasted access code from that link. Implied if the CLI detects you
are on a remote session.
