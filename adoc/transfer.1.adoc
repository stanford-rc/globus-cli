= GLOBUS TRANSFER(1)

== NAME

globus transfer - Submit a transfer task

== SYNOPSIS

*globus transfer* ['OPTIONS'] -- SOURCE_ENDPOINT_ID:SOURCE_PATH DEST_ENDPOINT_ID:DEST_PATH

*globus transfer* ['OPTIONS'] SOURCE_ENDPOINT_ID DEST_ENDPOINT_ID --batch *<* 'INPUT_LINE(s)'...

== DESCRIPTION

The *globus transfer* command submits an asynchronous task that copies files
and/or directories between endpoints.

*globus transfer* has two modes. Single target, which transfers one
file or one directory, and batch, which takes in several lines to transfer 
multiple files or directories. See "Batch Input" below for more information.

*globus transfer* will always place the dest files in a
consistent, deterministic location.  The contents of a source directory will
be placed inside the dest directory.  A source file will be copied to
the dest file path, which must not be an existing  directory.  All
intermediate / parent directories on the dest will be automatically
created if they don't exist. 

If the files or directories given as input are symbolic links, they are
followed.  However, no other symbolic links are followed and no symbolic links
are ever created on the dest.

== Batch Input

If you use SOURCE_PATH and DEST_PATH without the --batch flag, you
will submit a single-file or single-directory transfer task. This has
behavior similar to 'cp' and 'cp -r' across endpoints.

Using '--batch', *globus transfer* can submit a task which transfers
multiple files or directories. Paths to transfer are taken from stdin.
Lines are split on spaces, respecting quotes, and every line is treated as
a file or directory to transfer.

Lines are of the form
[--recursive] SOURCE_PATH DEST_PATH

Empty lines and comments beginning with '#' are ignored.

Batch only requires a SOURCE_ENDPOINT and a DEST_ENDPOINT before passing lines,
on stdin, but if you pass SOURCE_PATH and/or DEST_PATH in the original command,
these paths will be used as prefixes to their respective paths on stdin.


== OPTIONS

*--batch*::

Starts batch mode input for transfers, which takes lines in the form 
[--recursive] SOURCE_PATH DEST_PATH from stdin to transfer multiple
files and/or directories. See "Batch Input" above for more information.

*-r, --recursive*::

If SOURCE_PATH and DEST_PATH are both directories, do a recursive transfer
of all files and directories inside of the source directory to the destination
directory. Note that for batch input, each directory must be marked as
recursive individually unlike 'globus delete'.

*-s, --sync-level [exists|size|mtime|checksum]*::

Set the level at which the transfer task will decide to replace a file at the
destination with a file at the source with the same name. If not set, 
+
*exists* will only copy files that do not exist at the destination
+
*size* will replace a file if the size of the destination file does not match
the size of the source file
+
*mtime* will replace a file if the timestamp of the destination file is older
than the timestamp of the source file
+
*checksum* will replace a file if the source and destination files have
different checksums.

*--preserve-mtime*::

Preserve the modification time of files transfered. Note that directories
will not have their modification times preserved.

*--verify-checksum / --no-verify-checksum*::

After transfer, verify that the source and destination file checksums match. 
If they don’t, re-transfer the entire file and keep trying until it succeeds. 
Defaults to True.

*--encrypt*::

Encrypt the transfer data channel. If either the source or the destination
endpoints has force_encryption set this will be done automatically.

*--delete*::

Delete extraneous files and directories in the dest directory.  Only
applies to recursive directory transfers.  For example, a recursive transfer of
/some/source/dir/ to /tmp/mydir/ will ensure /tmp/mydir/ will have no files not
in /some/source/dir/.  All other files in /tmp outside of /tmp/mydir/ are left
alone.

== EXAMPLES

Transfer a single file:
----
$ source_ep=ddb59aef-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec
$ dest_ep=ddb59af0-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec
$ globus transfer $source_ep:/share/godata/file1.txt $dest_ep:~/mynewfile.txt
----

Transfer a directory recursively:

----
$ source_ep=ddb59aef-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec
$ dest_ep=ddb59af0-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec
$ globus transfer $source_ep:/share/godata/ $dest_ep:~/mynewdir/ --recursive
----

Use the batch input method to transfer multiple files and or dirs:

----
$ source_ep=ddb59aef-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec
$ dest_ep=ddb59af0-6d04-11e5-ba46-22000b92c6ec
$ globus transfer $source_ep $dest_ep --batch
/share/godata/file1.txt ~/myfile1.txt
/share/godata/file2.txt ~/myfile2.txt
/share/godata/file3.txt ~/myfile3.txt
/share/godata ~/mygodatadir -r
<EOF>
