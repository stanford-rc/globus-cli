= GLOBUS GET-IDENTITIES(1)

== NAME

globus get-identities - Lookup Globus Auth identities

== SYNOPSIS

*globus get-identites* ['OPTIONS'] ['UUID_OR_USERNAME(s)']

== DESCRIPTION

The *globus get-identities* command takes in one or more user IDs and/or
usernames for Globus Auth identities, and looks up those identities.

Default output resolves each UUID to a username and each username to a UUID,
with one output per line in the same order as the inputs.
If a particular input had no corresponding identity in Globus Auth,
"NO_SUCH_IDENTITY" is printed instead.

If more fields are desired, --verbose will give tabular output, but does not
guarantee order and ignores inputs with no corresponding Globus Auth identity.
